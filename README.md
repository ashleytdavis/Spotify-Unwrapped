# Welcome to Spotify Unwrapped!

Spotify Unwrapped gives users the chance to test their knowledge of their own music palette!
Opposed to Spotify Wrapped, which provides users with their top artists and songs over the course
of the last year, Spotify Unwrapped has users try and guess what songs are part of their favorite
playlists!

This project was developed as a part of the Oasis Project Series. Members of the Project Series attend weekly hack and information sessions and develop a semester-long full-stack project.
